	<description>
		This project builds on 011-lounge-restyled and using div and span elements
		can divide the page into logical sections that can be styled individually.
		
		div: helps you add logical structure to your pages. It is like a container.
		
		new CSS property:
			+ width: lets you specify the width of the element's contents area.
			+ text-align: alignment for text and images
		
		selecting descendants:
			+ by using #elixirs h2 you are selecting the h2 elements within the
			element marked with id="elixirs"
		
		In this example, it is added a div element on the elixirs section of the page
		and it is styled as a handout menu.
		It is given a non-default width, to let the browser know that we dont want
		it to occupy as much space as available. Therefore, it is given a tall rectangular
		appearance.
		Then, it is styled in known ways by giving it a margin, padding, background image,
		etc.
		Then it is used a new technique to select specific elements within a div container,
		by using the syntax #elixirs [element], as in #elixirs h2. This lets us style
		the h2 headings without affecting any other h2 within the page.
