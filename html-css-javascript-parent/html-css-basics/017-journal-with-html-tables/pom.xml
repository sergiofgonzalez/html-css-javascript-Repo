	<description>
		This project is based on 010-journal-fonts and explores some topics related
		to tables and lists.
		
		Tables:
			elements: table, tr, th, td
			styling the table using classes and pseudo-classes.
			rowspan, to expand td for several rows

		Lists:
			customizing the bullets of an ul, using an image as a bullet.
		
		CSS Properties:
			list-style-type: lets you customize the marker using circles, disc,
			squares, none.
			
			list-style-image: lets you use an image instead of the predefined markers.
		
		journal:
			table color is performed using classes and regular css. This example also
			shows how to make a td to span across several rows using rowspan.
			It also demonstrate how to include tables within tables and how to select
			the header of the the internal tables in the CSS using the following selector:
				table table th {}
			Finally it demonstrate how to style lists using list-style-type and using
			a custom marker (an image) for the bullet points.
			
		journal-pseudo:
			table color is performed using pseudo classes, which is more convenient
			because that way we don't need to annotate every even tr with the attribute
			class="cellcolor".
