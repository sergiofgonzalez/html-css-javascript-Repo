		This project contains very simple html pages with basic JavaScript.
		
		hello-js.html:
			basic page with a script element defined in the head section of the page.
			Within that script element, it is defined a JavaScript program that
			invokes the setTimeout() function passing another function and a delay
			in msecs.
			After the time has expired, the given function is called. The function
			is declared right below the invocation of the setTimeout() and it simply
			pops-up a message using the JavaScript alert function.
			
		while-js.html:
			same basic page with a script that demonstrate the while loop.
			It is defined a numeric variable that is given an initial value that is
			decremented with each of the executions of the loop.
			In each iteration, something is written on the page using the document.write()
			method.
			When the loop is finished, document.write() is used to display a final message.
			It is interesting to use Chrome to debug the JavaScript: to do that just
			open the Developer Tools and then, select sources and locate the section with
			the JavaScript code. There you can add some breakpoints, watches, etc.
			In order to see it running, just reload the page.
			
		if-js.html :
			Demonstrates a basic if statement.
		
		console-js.html:
			Demonstrates how to use the console.log() method and see the console output.
			
		99-bottles-js.html:
			Simple program that displays in the log the 99 bottles of beer song using
			JavaScript. The program declares variables (string and numeric), and while
			loop and if's.
			
		external-js.html:
			The same program as before, but with the JavaScript program in its own file.
			The HTML page includes a script element, but this time with a src attribute
			that is used to give the location of the JavaScript code.
