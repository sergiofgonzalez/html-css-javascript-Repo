		CSS: each CSS statement consists of a location, a property on that location and
		a style to apply to that property.
		
		CSS statements are called rules.
		
		Rules can be combined using comma:
		
		h1, h2 {
			color: gray;
		}
		
		Rules can appear multiple times for the same location.
		
		The location is called the selector
		
		The elements within a block element for which a style is defined inherit the
		styles. For example, elements defined within p inherit the CSS rules defined
		for p. If you move it further up to the body, then all elements will be affected.
		
		Inheritance can be overridden by specifying a different rule for a given element.
		
		The browser knows which rule to apply by using 'the most specific' rule. If there
		is a rule for body and a more specific rule for p, the rule for p will be applied.
		
		The project leverages on 007-lounge-html5 to include links to a CSS file named
		lounge.css.
		
		This CSS contains very basic styles (font family, colors, horizontal lines, etc.)
		
		No classes are used.
