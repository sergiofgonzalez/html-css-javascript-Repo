		This project is based on 004-journal and explores font capabilities of HTML and
		CSS.
		
		font-family:
			+ sans-serif  
				- fonts without serif, more readable than serif on computer screens
				- Examples: Verdana, Arial, Geneva, ...
			+ serif
				- fonts with serifs (decorative barbs), typically associated with the look of newspapers print.
				- Examples: Times, Times New Roman, Georgia
			+ monospace
				- fonts with constant width characters
				- Examples: Courier, Courier New, Consolas, ...
			+ cursive
				- fonts that look handwritten
				- Examples: Comic Sans, Apple Chancery, ...
			+ fantasy
				- stylized, decorative fonts
				- Examples: Impact
		
		typically, you specify the font-family property and a list of fonts, that should
		conclude with the specification of a family:
			font-family : Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;
						
		font-size: can be specified in px, or in pct to a font-size inherited from the
		parent element. You can also specify a scaling factor units (em) which is similar to pct.
		You can also specify sizes with keywords such as x-small, large, xx-large, etc.
			Recommended pattern:
				+ Choose a keyword for the font-size of the body rule.
				+ Specify the font sizes of the other elements relative to the body
				font-size using either em or pct.
		
		font-weight: bold, etc.
		font-style: italic, oblique, ...
		color: by name, by rgb pcts as in rgb(80%, 40%, 0%); or rgb(255, 25, 0) or in hex #ff1000
			{ the formula to map pcts in values is y =  (x * 255) / 100 }
		Note that there is a shorthand if each two digit pair shares the same numbers as in
			#cb0 for #ccbb00, or #1ea for #11eeaa...
		text-decoration: underline, overline, none, etc.
		
		
		Web Fonts : allows you to deliver a font as part of the payload of your page, so that
		the client will receive the font when it is not installed in the system. This is done
		with a special css rule @font-face.
						
						
		The project consist in structuring a journal web page that includes a title,
		a description and a sequence of three entries of the journal, all of them sharing
		the same structure: date, an optional image and some text.
			
		journal.html :
			The main page for the Journal.
