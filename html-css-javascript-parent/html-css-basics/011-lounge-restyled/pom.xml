		This project builds on 009-lounge-css-classes and incorporates some advanced
		styling techniques such as the box model, media queries and responsive CSS.
		
		selectors for ids, class is for groups of elements that should be applied the
		same style. For ids selector # is used as in #guarantee. If you have to select
		the p element within the id=guarantee you would use p#guarantee.
				
		Several stylesheets can be linked in the head element, to provide some short of
		overriding mechanisms. Thus instead of modify a base stylesheet, you can add a
		second stylesheet and override some of the values of the base style. This
		along with the media attribute of the link element lets you prepare a specific
		stylesheet that works with mobile devices, or printers.
		For example:
			&lt;link href="print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print"&gt;
		will only be enabled if it is a printer.
				
		
		Media queries: it is a way of targetting your CSS to devices with specific
		properties:
			@media screen and (min-device-width: 481px) {
				#guarantee {
					margin-right: 250px;
				}
			}
		
		There are special properties that control screen sizes of the devices:
		max-device-width, min-device-width : max and min width of the device screen
		max-width, min-width : max and min width of the browser window
		
		Using these properties along with the specification of several CSS you can obtain
		a responsive design in the page. In the project, it is specified a base CSS when
		browser screen larger than 480px, and mobile CSS for screens smaller than 480px.
		It is also added a specific CSS when the page is going to be printed.
