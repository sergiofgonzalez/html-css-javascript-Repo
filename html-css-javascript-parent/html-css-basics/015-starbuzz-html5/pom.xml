		This project is based on starbuzz-v3, (index-v8, but without the award) and it 
		is rebranded using HTML5.

		HTML5 elements:
			+ header : for the header container
			+ footer : for the footer container
			+ aside  : for the sidebar
			+ section: for the sections of the page (drinks, main container)
			+ article: a self-contained piece of content, usually defined within a section
			+ time   : to tag datetime values
			+ nav    : to identify the navigation toolbar of the page
			+ video  : to embed video content on the page (as if it was an img). You can
			           even supply several formats an a message to display if the browser
			           does not support the video element.

		The CSS is also updated in order to apply the styles that used to refer to the
		ids to the new ones that are applied to elements.

		index.html + starbuzz.css:
			This example is the same page layout as in 014- v8, but using HTML5 elements
			instead of id. As a refresher, the page uses CSS tables for positioning
			the drinks, main and sidebar content, and it also displays a header and a footer.
			A few things on the sidebar are also added: the slogan is given a bold appearance
			and that stylish red-brown color. 
			The link to the BEAN MACHINE is also given some style.
			Besides, as we'll be using headers in the blog page, and the stylesheet is shared
			among the pages, we have to add the class="top" in our header.
		
		blog.html + starbuzz.css:
			With the same style as the index page, it is created a page to hold some entry
			blogs in the main section. The idea is to keep the drinks and sidebar the same
			as the index page and just change the main section to a blog.
			The blog is created as a section with id="blog" and each of the blog entries
			is tagged as an article.
			Within the article, we have a header with the blog entry name and a date. As
			we had a previous header in the page, this one has to be tagged with a new 
			class="top", so the article header and the top header can be styled separately.				
			
			This blog page also features a navigation toolbar, which consists of a list of
			links wrapped in a nav element. The list is styled very specifically in the CSS
			to prevent other lists appearing on the page to be styled just like the navigation
			toolbar.
			 	
			Finally, an entry blog featuring a video! which is as simple as an img tag.
