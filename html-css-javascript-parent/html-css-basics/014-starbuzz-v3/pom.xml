		This project is based on starbuzz-v2 and gives it a new style:

		CSS property:
			clear : use the clear property on an element to request that as the element
			is being flowed onto the page, not floating content is allowed on the left,
			right or both sides of the element.
			
			position: static (go with the flow), absolute (ignore the element in the
			flow and position it with the given info), fixed (absolute to the top-left
			origin of browser's window) and relative (take an element and flow it on the
			page). When using absolute positioning, you can use percentages instead of px.
			
			CSS tables:
				This consists in setting a div container for all the elements that you
				want laid-out in a table. Then you also identify also the elements that
				you want in each row.
				Then in the CSS you identify each of the elements for a given row with
				the property display: table-cell.
				New properties (for CSS tables):
					border-spacing: adds spacing to the cells of the table.
					display: table, table-row, table-cell.

		index-v1.html + starbuzz.css:
			Added CSS for starbuzz's new index page. Basic styles including several
			div containers: header, main, sidebar and footer.
			The header includes an image and background color.
			The main and sidebar includes a background image.
			The footer includes the copyright and legal info.
			
		index-v2.html + starbuzz-v2.css:
			html is reformatted to make the sidebar floating to the right. 
			To solve some overlapping problems between the sidebar and the footer
			we introduce the CSS clear property to make the footer appear always
			behind the main or sidebar element.
			This has an unforeseen consequence: there is a gap either between the main
			content and the footer, or the sidebar and the footer.
			This is solved in v3...
		
		index-v3.html + starbuzz-v3.css:
			html is reformatted again, with the main content put on top of the sidebar,
			so that information-wise it is correct (in html readers, and some mobiles
			v2 makes the sidebar to be read/seen before the main content!!).
			Nevertheless, this design has also the little problem that the sidebar expands
			so that it looks a bit weird (navigation and sidebars are typically fixed-size).
			This is because the page has a liquid design. Next version explores a frozen
			design. 
			
		index-v4.html + starbuzz-v4.css:
			Explores the frozen (as opposed to liquid) design. This consists in creating
			a div container wrapping all body elements and setting a fixed width on
			that container (say 800px). 
			This frozen design does not look good when the page is maximized because it
			is not responsive when the browser page size is increased (margins appear on
			the right).
			The next version uses a jello (not liquid, nor frozen) design.
		
		index-v5.html + starbuzz-v5.css:
			Explores the jello design. This centers the contents in the browser window,
			adding margin space to both right and left, which does not look too good
			either.	
			The only alternative left for us is use absolute positioning.
			
		index-v6.html + starbuzz-v6.css:
			This changes completely the approach, and thus it is based on index-v1.html 
			and	starbuzz-v1.css. There are still some problems related to window sizing.
			
		index-v7.html + starbuzz-v7.cc:
			This example is based on the first version but uses CSS table to achieve
			a 2-column style. In this case, the only thing that needs fixing is the margin
			on header and footer that needs to be reduced a little bit.
