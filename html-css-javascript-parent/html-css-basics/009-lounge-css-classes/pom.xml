	<description>
		This project builds on 008-lounge-css and incorporates some additional CSS
		features such as CSS classes.
		
		CSS: each CSS statement consists of a location, a property on that location and
		a style to apply to that property.
		
		CSS statements are called rules.
		
		Rules can be combined using comma:
		
		h1, h2 {
			color: gray;
		}
		
		Rules can appear multiple times for the same location.
		
		The location is called the selector
		
		The elements within a block element for which a style is defined inherit the
		styles. For example, elements defined within p inherit the CSS rules defined
		for p. If you move it further up to the body, then all elements will be affected.
		
		Inheritance can be overridden by specifying a different rule for a given element.
		
		The browser knows which rule to apply by using 'the most specific' rule. If there
		is a rule for body and a more specific rule for p, the rule for p will be applied.
		
		The project leverages on 007-lounge-html5 to include links to a CSS file named
		lounge.css.
		
		This CSS contains very basic styles (font family, colors, horizontal lines, etc.)
		
		CSS classes to style differently elements of the same type (paragraphs, headings,
		etc.). To use CSS classes you have to modify the element and also use class
		selectors in your CSS.
		
		CSS Validator can be found at: http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
