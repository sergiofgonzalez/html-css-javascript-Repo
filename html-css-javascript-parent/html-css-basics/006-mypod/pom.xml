		This project introduces everything related to images and the img tag:
			+ img is an inline element
			+ ensure the img always has the alt attribute for accessibility and text-only browsers
			+ the width and height attributes should be set to the original width and height of the image
			  to help the browser layout the page before the image is retrieved. To scale the image
			  use CSS instead!
			+ Use images as clickable links
			
		
		The purpose of the project is building a gallery-like webpage with clickable thumbnail images.
		At the beggining, only the text is laid out, then the images at the original sizes are added,
		then the thumbnails and finally the clickable images.
		
		index_large_pics.html :
			First version of the page featuring the original size images.
			
		index_thumbs :
			Second version of the page in which small copies of the original images are created and
			stored in the thumbnails folder. 	
			
		index_clickable_thumbs :
			Third version of the page in which the thumbnails are embedded in a tags to made them
			links.
			When the user clicks on the thumbnail a new page is displayed. This very simple pages
			are stored in the html folder.
		
		index.html :
			Final version of the page featuring a logo in the header of the web page.
